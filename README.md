# r/SpaceX Subreddit CSS & Design

This repository holds all the necessary assets, styles, and buildsteps necessary to generate a working, paste-able copy of the r/SpaceX CSS directly into the subreddit stylesheet. 
Edit the styles you wish, and then run the `gulp` `styles` and `reddify` tasks to generate a build. The output will appear as `subreddit.css` in the `/build` directory.

# Bugs
